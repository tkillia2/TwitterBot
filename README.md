# TwitterBot
Twitter Bot created that has been used to annoy friends through retweets, favorites, replies, and direct messages. Working on possible automation as well as creation of own tweets or more.

UPDATE:
Have automation in the form of a cronjob that is shown in cronjob.txt --> would be nice to find a server or host for this so that it will run when my computer is turned off

Also have removed the error with duplicate tweets using try/except -- and have added functionality where it will repsond to people with prices for Bitcoin --> can easily be done for other Cryptos

Bots Handle: @CryptoPricing
